    alert('This UI was designed by @musabalfawal and originally posted in a video on this tweet: https://x.com/60fpsdesign/status/1817060810780508356. I saw the video and decided to reproduce it (code a browser version) with an entire Vanilla Web Stack (pure HTML/CSS/JS) by looking to this video and trying a minimal and fair reproduction. This page was built without access to original Design Prototype, so there will be lots of variations as font size, colors, gutters, paddings, adaptations in micro-interactions, etc etc. Also this is a for-fun code, there are no tests, compatibility checks, fallbacks.. nothing. Pure madness! But in general it should meet the requirements of the UI/UX. And yes, I had lots of fun :P')
